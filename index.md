# Sergi Barroso
Cloud Systems Developer Lead @ Cloudreach GmbH

Computer engineer with more than 16 years of experience in IT industry. On the technical side, I have played different roles during these years such as system administrator, developer and system architect before moving to a Cloud focused system developer working following devops methedologies.

However, I also have experience as a team and technical leader on the management side. I have always enjoyed learning new technologies and methodologies, working hard to achieve challenges, and being proactive not only in my daily work but also on building a close team with the people I work with. I think that being a technology enthusiast, learning everyday and having fun in the process is the only way to be successful in the IT world.
